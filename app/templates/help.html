                    <p>The Address Index User Interface (UI) provides an address searching and matching service to users on the ONS network. To log in to the service, enter the same username and password used to log into your PC/Laptop.</p>
                    <p>If you are on the ONS network and are unable to access the service, please email <a href="mailto:ai.users@ons.gov.uk">Address Index</a></p>
                    <p>To provide access to users outside the ONS network, mainly Other Government Departments, the Address Index service will be accessible through the use of an Application Program Interface (API).</p>
                    <p>During the Private Beta external users are supplying bulk input files via MoveIt.</p>

                        Provide as much of the address as possible for best results.<br>
                        The search is optimised for matching addresses in administrative data, not, for example displaying all the addresses in a given postcode.<br>
                        The filter will work with the preset values of 'commercial' or 'residential'. Additionally you can use a specific value, eg RD06, or a partial value followed by a * for a 'starts with' match, eg RD0*.

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Validation and Address Format</strong> - The only validation done on the input string is to check that a non-empty string is supplied. No checks are made as to what address parts are included. Whatever is supplied is processed by the API.  The exception to this is if the input is only a number, it is assumed to be a UPRN and matched accordingly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bookmarking</strong> - The address string (URL encoded) and other parameters are echoed to the URL bar so you can bookmark a single search or clerical tool result and send it to someone else. It will recreate the page as saved such as expanding the chosen address in the clerical tool. Note that the PAF / LA toggle is done on the client so is not bookmarkable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Paging</strong> - The maximum number of pages is 100 or the number of results / number of results per page. In the UI the number of results per page is set to 10 and cannot be overridden in the URL. Note that as well as next / previous buttons you can jump to a page number using the page= query string parameter in the URL.</li>
                        <li><strong>Google Maps</strong> - Note that this takes you to the exact latitude / longitude from AddressBase rather than where Google thinks the marker should go.</li>
                        <li><strong>Epochs</strong> - A major new version of Addressbase is supplied every 6 weeks. These versions are called Epochs. The current Epoch number is shown the top right of the screen, along with the version number of the code which is also a link to GitHub. </li>
                        <li><strong>Internet Explorer</strong> - This site works on all modern browsers. However, Internet Explorer should have Compatability View off (right click cog icon top right to show the menu bar: Tools > Compatability View Settings > ensure Display Intranet Sites In Compatibility Mode is unticked). </li>
                    </ol>
